In order to compile the application, execute below commands in the source directory from the terminal. If it is being compiled on 32bit platform the below commands can be executed directly, if being compiled on 64 bit platform, powerusb.cpp has to be edited to point to the 64 bit versions of the shared libraries. Edit line 24 in powerusb.cpp to point to the 64bit versions of shared libraries
	- Change line 24 in powerusb.cpp 
		sharedLibraryHandle = dlopen ("./lib/32bit/libpowerusb.so", RTLD_LAZY);
		to
		sharedLibraryHandle = dlopen ("./lib/64bit/libpowerusb.so", RTLD_LAZY);
	- Then compile with the following commands

Commands :
	g++ -fPIC -Wall -g -c `pkg-config libusb-1.0 --cflags` *.cpp
	g++ powerusb.o -Wall -g `pkg-config libusb-1.0 --libs` -ldl  -o powerusb

The above commands have been tested on Ubuntu 11.10 for other versions use the above commands with necessary changes.
